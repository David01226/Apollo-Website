    bodyText="With the UK Government announcing its goal of becoming a net – zero emissions economy by 2050 we will all have a part to play. With this in mind, the Government has put in place a ban on the sale of cars and vans powered entirely by petrol and diesel by 2035. 
    <br><br>
    This will mean that over the coming years many homeowners in the UK make the switch to either a fully electric or hybrid vehicle. An EV charger at home is essential to ensure that their vehicle remains charged and useable to allow homeowners to continue to go about their daily lives as normal.
    <br><br>
    There are a range of EV Chargers all with different features. The guide below will give you more information on what may be best and most suitable way for you to charge your electric vehicle.
